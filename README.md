# Game of rock paper scissors all times favorite
Playing a game of rock paper scissors like children :)

A classic two-person game. Players start each round by saying, “Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!” On “shoot,” each player holds out their fist for a rock, a flat hand for paper, or their index and middle finger for scissors. Rock crushes scissors, scissors cut paper, and paper covers rock. See who wins each round! This is a good way to decide who goes first in other games.

# HOW TO PLAY ROCK-PAPER-SCISSORS
The game is played with three possible hand signals that represent a rock, paper, and scissors. The rock is a closed fist; paper is a flat hand with fingers and thumb extended and the palm facing downward; and scissors is a fist with the index and middle fingers fully extended toward the opposing player. Rock wins against scissors; paper wins against rock; and scissors wins against paper. If both players throw the same hand signal, it is considered a tie, and play resumes until there is a clear winner.

The hand signals are given simultaneously by both players. The ritual used to get players in sync with each other so they can deliver their throws simultaneously is called the prime. This action requires retracting the player’s fist from full-arm extension towards the shoulder and then back to full extension. To ensure a fair match the players must be in sync with their primes. Players must determine before play how many times they pump their arms during the prime phase, usually two or three times before the final delivery of their throw.

Rock-paper-scissors is a quick win-loose game that is often used to determine who will go first or who will win some other small privilege.

## Best for: 
Two players How to play: In rock-paper-scissors, two players will each randomly choose one of three hand signs: rock (made by making a fist), paper (made by laying your hand flat), or scissors (made by holding out two fingers to look like scissors). Both players show their signs at the same time to see who will win.
Here are the rules that determine which sign beats another:
## Rock wins over scissors (because rock smashes scissors)
## Scissors win over paper (because scissors cut paper)
## Paper wins over rock (because paper covers rock)
